// Daily Question - 06/04/2023
// 1. Write a program that takes an integer as input and checks if it is a prime number or not. If the number is prime, the program should print “Yes, 
// {NUMBER} is prime.” If the number is not prime, the program should print “No, {NUMBER} is not prime.” e.g. “Yes, 13 is prime.”
// 2. Given a range of numbers, write a program that finds and prints all the prime numbers within that range. The program should take two inputs, 
// the lower and upper bounds of the range. The program should then iterate through all the numbers in the range and determine if each number is prime. 
// If a number is prime, it should be printed to the console. Finally, the program should print a message indicating the total number of prime numbers found within the range.
