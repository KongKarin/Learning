// 1. Suppose you are interested in weather forecasting and want to create a program that can convert temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit and predict the weather based on historical data and current conditions. Here are two questions to help you practice your coding skills:
//      - Write a program that converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The program should be able to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa based on user input.
//      - Write a program that predicts the weather based on historical data and current conditions. The program should take input from the user, such as current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover, and use historical weather data to predict the current weather conditions.
