// 1. You are the coach of a track team and you want to calculate the speed of your runners during a sprint race. 
//    The acceleration they are capable of is 2 m/s^2, and the time it takes for them to cross the finish line is 12 seconds. Find the velocity
// 2. You are a rocket engineer who is designing a rocket launch. You need to calculate the force needed to lift the rocket off the ground based on its mass, 
//    which is 2400 kg, and the acceleration required for liftoff, which is 10 m/s^2. How much force that necessary to take it off?
// 3. You are studying the motion of a falling object after the physics class of the week. Some people have accidentally dropped a book from 
//    the rooftop and you have suddenly seen it, you have just ended the class so you still have some knowledge that you learned recently. 
//    The acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2, and the time it takes for the object to hit the ground your guess would be 5 seconds. 
//    You are picking up the book and feel it around 1.2 kilograms. I want to find the height of that building and force if just in case the book 
//    hit the head of some people and will cause of the accident.
